This game was developed with the support of ChatGPT and Claude.
I do not claim full credit for writing the code manually—I primarily guided the AI by giving commands and refining the output.
If you find any ways to improve the code or make it more efficient, feel free to modify it yourself or let me know. I’m always happy to learn and improve in the future.
